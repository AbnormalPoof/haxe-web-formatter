# Haxe Web Formatter
Small web client for formatting haxe files, powered by [haxe-formatter](https://github.com/HaxeCheckstyle/haxe-formatter).

Access it through here: https://abnormalpoof.github.io/haxe-web-formatter!

Do note that this uses a fork of haxe-formatter by me, changes can be viewed here: https://github.com/AbnormalPoof/haxe-formatter/tree/add-functions-for-formatting-string-inputs

# TODO
- [ ] Don't use a pre-compiled formatter build!! Instead have it be compilable I guess.
